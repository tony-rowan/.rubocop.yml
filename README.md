# .rubocop.yml
My personal preferred [rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop) configuration.

## Usage
These styles can be used by copying the `.rubocop.yml` file or, if there is a
need to make further modifications, by inheriting from this one. In `.rubocop.yml`:

```yml
inherit_from:
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tony-rowan/.rubocop.yml/main/.rubocop.yml
```
